-------------------------------------------------------

Suday:     2020.04.05

  - Notes:  
    - poor sleep (Saturday night).  high anxiety.  
    - I was able to be supportive to a friend, but planed activities did not 
      happen.

Monday:    2020.04.06

  - [x] Meditation (Tara Brock - Radical Compassion)
  - [x] my [Finger Prehab] warmups (See below).
  - [x] steep face climbing 
    - 5x(1 min climb, 5 mins rest 24 degrees overhang, speed 22 feet per min.)
  - [x] vertical crack climbing
    - incline set to 0 degrees (vertical), speed 18 feet per minute. 
    - [Couch to 5k]: week 7, day 1
    - Climb 25 mins.
  - [ ] Back Supported Dumbbell Press 
  - [ ] Pull Ups.  5 sets of 3 reps, focus on good form.

  - Notes:
    - poor sleep.  Room mates had TV on loud entire night.
    - steep face climb - this set felt properly hard.  Got this angle first
      try, but it was far from a given.  last set especially felt right at 
      the edge. 
    - vertical crack climbing 
      - Sooo hard.  Tried for 25 mins continous climbing, made it 22:04 seconds.
        Heart rate maxed out at 187 before I gave up.  For now, that's 
        respectable.  Next time try for 25 mins again.  try to hit a HR 
        of 188 or higher before giving up (if you simply must).  Do not increase 
        duration again untill you get 3 consecutive redpoints at 25 mins.
    - Body weight 162.4.  Weight loss has slowed to a more healthy pace.

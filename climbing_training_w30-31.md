  - rest day

# Tuesday, July 21st through Thurdsay July 23rd, 2020

  - Today I was stung by a scorpion on my right heel.  
  - it was quite painful, and I took a couple days off from training.
    - day one was intense pain that made it difficult to concentrate.
    - day two I had intense "pins and needles" or "leg fell asleep" 
      type pain from toes to mid calf. 
    - day three pain weakens throughout the day but some joint pain 
      in my ankle lingered.

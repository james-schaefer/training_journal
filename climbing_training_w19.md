  - Notes:
    - the easy jog this morning felt amazing.  more refreshing than tireing.
    - Bench press: missed a rep on the first set, this was very difficult.
    - Pull Ups.  Originally planed for the work set to be at 20 lbs less than
      body weight, but during warm-ups, the -40 felt very hard. 
    - anaerobic face climbing: for having just come off an injury, this was
      almost exactly the right intensity level.  Max HR 166.  I'm pouring sweat
      and completely boxed.
      - there was an exciting moment when a foot hold spun loose.  
    - steep face climbing: felt harder than anaerobic face... but yet again, max HR was higher on 
      anaerobic face.

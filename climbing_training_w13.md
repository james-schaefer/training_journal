    - crack climbing: waaaaay easier than Saturday.  first set MHR 160.  second set MHR 168.
      coulda kept going at the end of the second set.  I think 20 mins will go this Saturday.
    - pull-ups waited 8 mins between sets (up from 5).  could actually do 5x5 this way.  
      - got some creeky soreness in my shoulder at the end of this set...
      - form was sloppy with some subtle kipping on last rep. 
      - next time, consider taking 20 lbs. off and focus on form.
